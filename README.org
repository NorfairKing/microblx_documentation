* Microblx Documentation

This repository contains documentation for the microblx metamodel.

The documentation can be viewed directly on github via the org directory.
You can start at [[https://github.com/NorfairKing/microblx_documentation/blob/master/org/index.org][the index]]. Note that links between the files will not work on github, only when you generate the html code.

** Generating the html
The documentation can also be used to generate html code using the makefile.
Just run the following command to generate the html code. It will then be available in the public_html directory.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
make
#+END_EXAMPLE
You will need emacs org-mode to do this.

If ever you add any svg pictures in the illustrations directory, you must run the following command to use it in the documentation.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
make images
#+END_EXAMPLE
You will need inkscape to do this.
