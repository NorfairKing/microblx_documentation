* Block Types
** Generic block

   A generic microblock contains the following structural primitives.
   - ports file:img/parts/microblock_port.png

     Ports give access to the data that the microblock processes.
   - input-triggers file:img/parts/microblock_trigger_in.png

     Firing input-triggers causes the microblock to start working.
   - output-triggers file:img/parts/microblock_trigger_out.png

     Output-triggers allow the microblocks to fire input-triggers of other microblocks.
   - configuration values file:img/parts/microblock_config.png

     Configuration values allow a microblock to have its behaviour adapted externally.
   - metadata file:img/parts/microblock_meta-data.png.
     The metadata represents the formal semantics of the microblock. It consists of the following three values.
     - meta model UID: the identifier of the meta model, or Domain-Specific Language (“DSL”), that has been used to model the microblock.
     - model UID: the identifier of the concrete model that describes the semantic meaning of the microblock, and that uses the above-mentioned meta model as its language.
     - realisation UID: the identifier of this particular realisation of the above-mentioned model. The same model can, indeed, be realised multiple times, and it is necessary to be able to differentiate between these instances. 


   A generic block is obtained by composing cblocks, iblocks and sblocks.
   A composite block can also just be a new clock, iblock or sblock.
** Computation block (cblock)
   #+CAPTION: A generic cblock
   [[file:img/generic/cblock.png]]
   
   A cblock represents *computational* behaviour, i.e., functions.
   A cblock can have all above mentioned structured primitives, except output triggers.
*** Examples
    - a low-pass filter
    - a Singular Value Decomposition. 
** Interaction block (iblock)
   #+CAPTION: A generic iblock
   [[file:img/generic/iblock.png]]

   An iBlock represents constraints between the data involved in cblock interactions.
   Access to that data takes place through the data port structural primitive, by means of read() and write() functions.
   In addition to data ports, an iblock also has configuration values and semantic identifiers.
*** Examples
    - a memory buffer
    - a road map. 
** Scheduling block (s-Block)
   #+CAPTION: A generic s-block
   [[file:img/generic/sblock.png]]

   An sBlock represents constraints on the sequencing of cblock computations.
   Activation of (internal and/or external) computations is available via (one or more) trigger ports, by means of trigger() functions.
   In addition to trigger ports, an sblock also has configuration values and semantic identifiers.
*** Examples
    - a for loop and other iterators
    - rule-based function call scheduling.
