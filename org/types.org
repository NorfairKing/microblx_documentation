** Block Types
*** Generic block
    #+CAPTION: A generic microblock
    [[file:img/generic-microblock.png]]

    A generic block is obtained by composing cblocks, iblocks and sblocks.
    A composite block can also just be a new clock, iblock or sblock.
*** Computation block (cblock)
    A cblock represents *computational* behaviour, i.e., functions.
    A cblock can have all above mentioned structured primitives, except output triggers.
**** Examples
     - a low-pass filter
     - a Singular Value Decomposition. 
*** Interaction block (iblock)
    #+CAPTION: An i-block
    [[file:img/microblock-iblock.png]]

    An iBlock represents constraints between the data involved in cblock interactions.
    Access to that data takes place through the data port structural primitive, by means of read() and write() functions.
    In addition to data ports, an iblock also has configuration values and semantic identifiers.
**** Examples
     - a memory buffer
     - a road map. 
*** Scheduling block (s-Block)
    #+CAPTION: An s-block
    [[file:img/microblock-sblock.png]]

    An sBlock represents constraints on the sequencing of cblock computations.
    Activation of (internal and/or external) computations is available via (one or more) trigger ports, by means of trigger() functions.
    In addition to trigger ports, an sblock also has configuration values and semantic identifiers.
**** Examples
     - a for loop and other iterators
     - rule-based function call scheduling.
