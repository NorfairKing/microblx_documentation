* Microblock composition
Microblocks can be, and are supposed to be composed.
To explain this, the concept of a link must be made explicit.
** Links
   A link between two ports represents a connection between the ports.
   The connection, however, has nothing to do with networking.
   There is no 'flow' of data. Data remains in the iblocks and can be *accessed* by cblocks via connected ports.
   As an example, look at the following block composition.
